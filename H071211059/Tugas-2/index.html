        <p>
          Since we send your order directly from Sudiang, there is a chance that
          you will have to pay import fees in your country. These fees are your
          responsibility since you are importing goods into your country. Our
          site offers a customs friendly invoice tool that you can find on the
          check out page. It can help lower the amount of import fees but is by
          no means a guarantee to do so. Our product selection of anime figures
          and games includes close to 100.000 brand new and pre-owned items. We
          check the condition of every single item before we send it to you, to
          make sure you get what you are looking for when shopping with XY
          Store.

          <h3>One Piece: Log Collection Big Statue Series Roronoa Zoro</h3>
          <p>
            This display statue of Roronoa Zoro from "One Piece" is truly
            impressive! Reproducing the illustration from the August
            2010-released "Logue Town" Log Collection DVD jacket, Zoro is on the
            attack with his three swords, fighting his way through a vortex of
            waves! Every detail in Zoro and his outfit is carefully reproduced
            (take a close look at his hands), and the water is recreated with a
            clear material for realism; various bits of luxurious treasure are
            swept along too, making for a compelling presentation! The statue is
            also about 50cm tall, making it extra eye-catching -- you'll be
            proud to own this amazing item! Order yours today!

          <h3>
            1/6 Batman: The Killing Joke The Joker "One Bad Day" ARTFX Statue
          </h3>
          <p>
            In 1988, Brian Boland and Alan Moore colloborated to create "The
            Killing Joke," a special one-shot "Batman" comic largely about the
            Joker which has become a modern classic -- and now Kotobukiya brings
            us a detailed display figure of the Joker at a pivotal moment from
            that comic! Seen at the moment he emerges from Ace Chemical's waste
            canal to find his skin bleached white, his lips red, and his hair
            turned green, the Joker succumbs to insanity in a wild storm of
            uncontrollable laughter. The Joker's expression and rumpled clothing
            all tell the story at a single glance.
